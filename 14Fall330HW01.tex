6. Rosen, Section 1.2: Exercise 18 

Solution:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{Jas} $p$: Jasmine attends the party.
\item \label{Sam} $q$: Samir attends the party.
\item \label{Kan} $r$: Kanti attends the party.
\item \label{JasAndSam} $p \land q$ \to Jasmine will not be happy. If Jasmine and Samir attend the party, Jasmine will become unhappy.
\item \label{SamImpKan} $q \to r$: If Samir will attend, then Kanti will be there.
\item \label{NotJasNotKan} $\lnot p \lto \lnot r$: If Jasmine does not attend, then Kanti will not attend.
\end{enumerate}

By \ref{JasAndSam} we have known that if \ref{Jas} and \ref{Sam} are both true, then Jasmine will not be happy. So if one of them is false, Jasmine will be happy. If \ref{Jas} is false, then from \ref{NotJasNotKan}, we know that \ref{Kan}  is false. So we can only invite Samir. But by \ref{SamImpKan}, since Kanti will not be there, Samir will not be there either, i.e, \ref{Sam}  is false. The result is none of three will attend. If Samir does not attend the party, i.e, \ref{Sam} is false, we can make \ref{Jas}  or \ref{Kan} true. By \ref{NotJasNotKan}, we know that if \ref{Kan} is true, then \ref{Jas} is true. And no one is unhappy. So we can invite Jasmine, Kanti or both of them.
